# Data science for science, common pitfalls when applying machine learning to astronomy

This is a repository containing the code for figures in the paper with the correpsonding title, also included in the repo. It also contains notebooks with more elaborate examples.

Examples use common, non-astronomical data sets, for the following reasons:
1. It makes the examples more general.
2. It makes the examples simpler.
3. It doesnt't bias towards any sub-field of astronomy, and reduces the chances of "naming and shaming" interpretations of the current paper.


## Software 

In order to eb able to run all example code it should suffice to create a conda environment using the requirements file in this repo:
```bash
$ conda env create -n ds4s -f environment.yml
$ conda activate ds4s
```
It is all based on Python 3.9.
